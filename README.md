Simple language server exploration. Toy project.

## What is this?
This is a small toy project to learn more about LSP's and maybe implement it into a real world use.
It should help to show where some 'needs' are defined in the end. But unsure if that will be the case.

The goal for an MVP would be as follows:

- [x] Server can start (the client can start the server via command)
- [x] Server communicates with the client
- [ ] Can handle the following methods: 
   - [x] Initialize
   - [ ] Go to definition
        - [ ] Server understands what file it's in and can search for 'symbols' under cursor
